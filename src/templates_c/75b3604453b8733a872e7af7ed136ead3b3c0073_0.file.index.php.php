?><p>I developed an interest in computers and the technology behind them at a young age. Ever since I have been an avid hobby programmer, tech power user, tinkerer and curious soul - always desiring to know the mechanics and theory behind how things work, in all areas of life. My first programming language was BASIC which I learned in the mid 1990s, advancing to Visual Basic, PHP, Java, Javascript, C#, Python, and TypeScript.</p>
<p>When I am not programming or designing and building computer systems, I like to take my dogs on walks and hikes around beautiful Minnesota, coloring, taking photographs, reading fiction novels, and writing.</p><?php }
